          <h2>Train your brain and improve your focus with the simple yet challenging math game</h2>
          <p>Adapted from an exercise that was used to measure cognitive focus in the popular book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, iAddThree engages your mind by bending the rules of basic math to give your brain the mental exercise it deserves.</p>
  
          <h3>THE RULES</h3>
          <p>It's simple. Just add 3 to each of the four numbers that are presented. The challenge? No double digits. Instead, you must wrap around to 0.</p>
          <p>Normally, 8+3=11, but in iAddThree, 8+3=1. Think of it as a line of numbers that are constantly repeating.</p>
          <p>8 -> 9 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3</p>
          <p>The struggle provided by this simple math game will have you boasting about your high score to all your friends.</p>
